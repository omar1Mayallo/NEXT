# What is This Repo ?

In this repo I upgrade my level in Next.js by know what, why and how for all things about Next.js.

## Folder Structure

In each folder, I will deal with a specific topic in the Next.js, and I will add a readme file to each folder to explain the content of the folder and also contain the sources that I used to search for the information that will be in it.
