# How NextJs works ?

Before we learn more advanced Next.js features, it would be helpful to understand the basics of how Next.js works. Let's see the journey of the Next.js applications.

Next.js provides a framework to structure your application, and optimizations that help make both the development process and final application faster. And to know how Next.js works, weâ€™ll look at what happens to your application code during these different stages:

- The environment where your code runs: `Development vs. Production`
- When your code runs: `Build Time vs. Runtime`
- Where rendering happens: `Client vs. Server`

## Development and Production Environments

You can think of environments as the context in which your code is running.<br/><br/>
**_Development_** : building and running the application on your local machine.<br/>
**_Production_** : process of making your application ready to be deployed and consumed by users.<br/>

Next.js provides features for both the development and production stages of an application.

### Development

In the development stage, Next.js optimizes for the developer and their experience building the application. It comes with features that aim to improve the Developer Experience such the [TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/typescript) and [ESLint integration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint), [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh), and more.

### Production

In the production stage, Next.js optimizes for the end-users, and their experience using the application. It aims to transform the code to make it `performant and accessible`.

but how Next.js implement this ?

Since each environment has different considerations and goals, there is a lot that needs to be done to move an application from development to production. For instance, the application code needs to be **_compiled, bundled, minified, and code split_**.

The Next.js Compiler handles much of these code transformations and underlying infrastructure to make it easier for your application to go to production.
This is made possible because Next.js has a compiler written in Rust, a low-level programming language, and [SWC](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler), a platform that can be used for [compilation](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/compiling), [minification](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/minifying), [bundling](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/bundling), and more. also Next.js has [built-in support for code splitting](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/code-splitting).
